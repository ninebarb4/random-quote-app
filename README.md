# FCC - Random Quote App - 1st project

Built using React and Material UI
This simple API that has end point for random quote "https://api.quotable.io/random".  (no keys required and all the randomisation done for me by hitting that one endpoint)
Practised using functional components (Hooks) useState, useEffect.
Material UI  - I used a Card template, Typography, Icon, makeStyles function to manage some of the styling
Loads data on first load and then again every time button is pressed.
Clicking button also rotates through array of background colours.
I wanted to have old text/new text fade in and out to make asyncronous calls a little less jumpy but not worked that out yet.
React - background color state managed in parent and state and setter passed down as props
Card component used it's own local state.
